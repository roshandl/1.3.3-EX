first consider the input as matrix which has i row and j column with element mij

look at matrix as a relation with three attributes: the row number, the column number & the value in that column & row. so we have:
   
M(I,J,v)

map: (i,j,mij)  for i,j=1 up to the number of rows & columns

reduce: apllying operator @  to the result of mij associated with the key-value pair (i,j).
the output comes from the result of grouping & aggregation opreation Y
  Y (i,j),@(mij)(M)


(a) :  put @ max
(b) : put @ AVG
(c) & (d):
look at matrix as a relation with two attributes: the value in that column & row and the number of occurrences for each integer
M(v,m)  --- v is the value of mij at relation M

map: (mij,m)  for i,j=1 up to the number of rows & columns
 
reduce: (mij,1)

map: N(w,1)    ---  w is the value of mij at relation N

reduce: * N(M)  ---- * is pojection (for each tuple in M eliminate tuple in N)
